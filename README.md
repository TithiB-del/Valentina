WRITE A SHORT, SHARP AND ON POINT DESCRIPTION OF YOUR PROJECT
```
Live life king size.
A website dedicated for the lovers who are desperately into dating xD
```
The problem it solves
DESCRIBE WHAT CAN PEOPLE USE IT FOR, OR HOW IT MAKES EXISTING TASKS EASIER/SAFER E.T.C (MARKDOWN SUPPORTED)
```
Get recommendations for various topics, like dating places, foods, gifts, etc with just one click, backed by a content based filtered reccommendation model, eliminating the need of googling or asking friends about ways to impress your crush/ask anyone out :3
Everything is automated now-why not dating tips?
If it fails, it contributes to the ML, if it passes, congratulations on your achievement.
Recommendation algorithms have been going crazy lately, & almost every company uses it to curate filtered stuff specially catered for our taste. In other words, our lives have been dominated by these algorithms, without us even realising it.
our data is being collected everyday, processed, & utilized by other companies to manipulate us into fulfilling their objectives, We have become a slave of our own greed of getting personalized stuff, feeding more & more data into the systems, so why not use it for a reasonable cause?

The USP of this project is, that it uses a recommendation algorithm by ingesting your browsing activity, purchase history, movies watched, & transaction history. It is different form other recommendation algos, as it aims to reduce the scope of you using prompt engineering to do your job. we will do that for you :'D

Challenges I ran into
TELL US ABOUT ANY SPECIFIC BUG OR HURDLE YOU RAN INTO WHILE BUILDING THIS PROJECT. HOW DID YOU GET OVER IT? (MARKDOWN SUPPORTED)

Making the recommendation algorithm. training the models would explode my laptop xD
Ideation phase began late, with the recommendation algorithm idea coming in at the last moment when a planned feature was already found to be live & running in the market (dearth of ideas I must say)
